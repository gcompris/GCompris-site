<p>Today we are releasing GCompris version 3.2.</p>
<p>This new version contains some bug fixes on multiple activities such as "Discover the International Morse code", "Control the hose-pipe" and music activities.</p>
<p>It also contains new graphics for all memory activities and for "Baby puzzle".</p>
<p>A new command-line argument (--difficulty {value|min-max}) has been added which allows users to force the difficulty filter at a given value or range.</p>
<p>The Andika font has been updated to its latest version (6.200).</p>

<p>It is fully translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale in fullyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>It is also partially translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale,oneStatus in partiallyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }} ({{ oneStatus }}%)</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>Thank you all, <br/>Timoth√©e & Johnny</p>

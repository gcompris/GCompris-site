<p>Today we are releasing GCompris version 2.3.</p>
<p>As we noticed that version 2.2 had been shipped with a bug that broke 3 activities ("Alphabet sequence", "Even and odd numbers" and "Numbers in order"), we decided to fix it quickly with a new maintenance release.</p>
<p>You can find packages of this new version for GNU/Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi and macOS on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/downloads{{ suffix }}.html">download page</a>. This update will be available soon in the Android Play store, the F-Droid repository and the Windows store.</p>
<p>Thank you all, <br/>Timoth√©e & Johnny</p>

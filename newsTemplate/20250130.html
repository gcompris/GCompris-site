<p>Today we are releasing GCompris version 25.0.</p>
<p>As you can see, we are now basing the major version number on the release year. This makes sense as we are doing one major version per year. It is also a good occasion to do it now to celebrate the 25 years of GCompris.</p>
<p>This new version contains 195 activities, including 5 new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li class="puce">"Sketch" is an activity for drawing freely with multiple tools to let children explore their creativity.</li>
<li class="puce">"Calculate with ten's complement" is the continuation of the existing ten's complement activities. This one helps the children to swap the numbers to easily compute a sum.</li>
<li class="puce">"Vertical addition" is an activity to write an addition and solve it.</li>
<li class="puce">"Vertical subtraction", is similar to the addition activity but for subtraction with the borrowing by regrouping method.</li>
<li class="puce">"Vertical subtraction (compensation)", is similar to the subtraction one with the borrowing by compensation method.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>It contains bug fixes and graphics improvements on multiple activities.</p>
<p>With the help of teachers, we rewrote a big part of the activities description to be clearer.</p>
<p>When we switch language in the menu, the new language is now applied directly, without having to restart GCompris.</p>
<p>On the technical size, it is also the first release using Qt6.</p>
<p>We have also set the graphical renderer to direct3d11 by default on Windows.</p>

<p>It is fully translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale in fullyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>It is also partially translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale,oneStatus in partiallyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }} ({{ oneStatus }}%)</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>You can find packages of this new version for GNU/Linux, Windows, Android and Raspberry Pi on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/downloads{{ suffix }}.html">download page</a>. This update will also be available soon in the Android Play store, the F-Droid repository and the Windows store.</p>

<p>Thank you all, <br/>Timoth√©e & Johnny</p>

<p>Today we are releasing GCompris version 26.0.</p>
<p>We are also releasing the first official version of our companion tool for teachers: GCompris-teachers! You can find more information about it on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/schools{{ suffix }}.html#gcompris-teachers">schools page</a>.</p>
<p>This new version contains 197 activities, including 2 new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li class="puce">"Drawing wheels" is an activity for drawing using a gear rotating in a cogwheel.</li>
<li class="puce">"Multiple choice questions" is an MCQ activity. Note that this activity is hidden by default. It becomes visible after some datasets for it have been sent from GCompris-teachers.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>It also contains bug fixes and improvements on multiple activities.</p>

<p>We ship translations for two more languages: Kannada and Tamil.</p>
<p>It is fully translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale in fullyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>It is also partially translated in the following languages:</p>
<ul>
  {% for oneLocale,oneStatus in partiallyTranslatedLocales %}
  <li class="puce">{{ oneLocale }} ({{ oneStatus }}%)</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>You can find packages of this new version for GNU/Linux, Windows, Android and Raspberry Pi on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/downloads{{ suffix }}.html">download page</a>. This update will also be available soon in the Android Play store, the F-Droid repository and the Windows store.</p>

<p>This version also contains several improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<br/>
<p>On the translation side, GCompris 3.0 contains 36 languages. 25 are fully translated: (Azerbaijani, Basque, Breton, British English, Catalan, Catalan (Valencian), Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Dutch, Estonian, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Norwegian Nynorsk, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Ukrainian). 11 are partially translated: (Albanian (99%), Belarusian (83%), Brazilian Portuguese (94%), Czech (82%), Finnish (94%), German (91%), Indonesian (95%), Macedonian (94%), Slovak (77%), Swedish (94%) and Turkish (71%)).</p>
<p>A special note about Ukrainian voices which have been added thanks to the organization "Save the Children" who funded the recording. They installed GCompris on 8000 tablets and 1000 laptops, and sent them to Digital learning Centers and other safe spaces for children in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Croatian voices have also been recorded by a contributor.</p>
<br/>
<p>As usual you can find packages of this new version for GNU/Linux, Windows, Android, Raspberry Pi and macOS on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/downloads{{ suffix }}.html">download page</a>. This update will also be available soon in the Android Play store, the F-Droid repository and the Windows store.</p>
<p>For packagers of GNU/Linux distributions, note that we have a new dependency on QtCharts QML plugin, and the minimum required version of Qt5 is now 5.12. We also moved from using QtQuick.Controls 1 to QtQuick.Controls 2.</p>
<p>Thank you all, <br/>Timoth√©e & Johnny</p>

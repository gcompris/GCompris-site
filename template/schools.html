	        <p>{% trans %}GCompris 1.0 lets educators select the level of activities according to the skill of each child. For example, in an activity that lets children practice numbers, you can select what numbers they can work with, leaving higher and more difficult numbers for a later stage. Or in an activity in which the child has to order pictures chronologically, you can grade the activity for children who can only read numbers or make it harder for children who can read both numbers and words.{% endtrans %}</p>

	        <p>{% trans %}This grading functionality allows you to propose training exercises to pupils to practice mathematics, language, science and humanities. They will also be able to play strategic games to train their problem-solving skills.{% endtrans %}</p>
            <br/>
	        <p>{% trans %}To provide a solid pedagogical background, GCompris levels of activities have been based on the French elementary school curriculum, which defines what French teachers must teach in class.{% endtrans %}</p>
